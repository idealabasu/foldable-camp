## Evaluation & Permission Form

We would like to run a survey on Friday at the conclusion of the course.  More information below.

Parents and Students Should have signed and filled out a permission form upon registration.  Please let me know if not.

> Participants in the course will be asked to participate in an evaluation of their experiences and perceptions. This is voluntary and all parents and students will be provided additional information at the time of enrollment to consent to participating in an end of the program survey. In order to continually improve the experiences of participating students, students will be provided a ten-minute survey at the completion of the course. The data will only be used if both parents and child consent to data collection; your childâ€™s status in the program is not impacted by the decision to complete the survey.  The program is partnering with the College Research and Evaluation Services Team (CREST) at ASU provide external evaluation support to grants and will never share participant identifiers with program faculty or staff. Responses will be aggregated and reported in summary form for program improvement and possibly presentations or publications, but no identifying information will ever be shared.  We appreciate your consideration to participate in this evaluation endeavor.

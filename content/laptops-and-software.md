We encourage students to bring their own laptop.  We are able to support the following operating systems*:

* Windows
* Mac
* Linux

_\*Unfortunately, chromebooks do not currently support the software and hardware we plan to use._

If you are bringing a laptop, please ensure your student has the proper user permissions for installing new software on the laptop.  Otherwise, please go ahead and install the following software in advance:

* [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
* [Silabs cp210x driver](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
* [Tracker](https://physlets.org/tracker/)
* [CreateSpace](https://techsupport.signwarehouse.com/create-space-software-support-resources/)

There are also a number of PCs in the classroom that will be available.

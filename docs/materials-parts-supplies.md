### Tables

Ideally: 8, four-person tables, spaced apart for teams of 4.

### Technology

* 1 laptop per team would be great.  Ideally 1 per table.
* 1 Soldering Iron
* 8 Power Strips (1 per Table)

### Networking

We will need wifi access, with only password restrictions. (No login pages).  If only wired internet is available, I can bring a travel wifi router.

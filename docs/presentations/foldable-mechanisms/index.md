## Why are we talking about foldable mechanisms?

![](img0000.png)


* Robots are mechanisms, or machines.
* Serial vs. Parallel
* Composed of links and joints

## Mechanisms


* A system of parts working together in a machine; a piece of machinery.

## Structures?


* What is a structure?

## Linkage


* A system of links; especially a system of links or bars which are jointed together and more or less constrained by having a link or links fixed and by means of which straight or nearly straight lines or other point paths may be traced

* https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/linkage

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_(mechanical)\

## Link


* An intermediate rod or piece for transmitting force or motion; especially, a short connecting rod with a hole or pin at each end.

## Joints


* In robotics, joints are the (moving) connections between rigid bodies
* Many different kinds of joints
* Folded devices use

## Degrees of Freedom


* “The number of independent parameters that define its configuration or state”
* The position of a single railcar (engine) moving along a track has one degree of freedom
* Position and orientation of a rigid body in space is defined by three components of translation and three components of rotation, which means that it has six degrees of freedom.

* Origami: Less about mechanisms than “structures” or “form”

## Origami is not about creating mechanisms


## “Foldable” Links


* How can you stiffen material to create a better link?
  * …
  * …
  * …
* Engineering Context: I-beams

## “Foldable” Joints


* What joints can you make with origami/kirigami techniques?
* How can you weaken material to create a better joint?
  * …
  * …
  * …

## Identical mechanisms, many ways to get there


* Four-Bar Linkage Example
* Sarrus Example

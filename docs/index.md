## Quick Overview

* **Daily Schedule:**  The camp will run 9-4pm Monday thru Friday June 12-16, 2023 in Peralta Hall, Room 103 on the ASU Polytechnic Campus.  See our [general information](/day-camp-general-info/#locations) page for map and details.
* We will hold a **student showcase** from **3-4pm on Friday, June 16**.  

## Check-in / Check-Out

* **Doors open at 9am.**  Check-in is _9:00am to 9:15am_.  
* **Doors close at 4pm.**  Please pick up your child between _3:45pm-4:00pm_.

We will station one of our teaching team out in Lot 30 near the [20-minute parking spots](https://goo.gl/maps/8kuUE78uMdwYcMw57) on _Monday morning_ to guide campers and parents to the room.  If you don't see anyone please proceed to the [classroom](https://goo.gl/maps/4x5X4Hikreym2yF39) to check your student in there.

It is highly encouraged that you drop your student off each day rather than have them drive and pay for parking, as it is the most economical option (Parking information [below](#parking)).  Lot 30 is the closest and easiest dropoff location.  There are 2 _free_ 20-minute pickup/dropoff spots located [here](https://goo.gl/maps/8kuUE78uMdwYcMw57).

We ask that you bring an ID each day, as our check-in/check-out procedure requires that we release students to an approved individual.  You should have filled out your check-in/check-out preferences during registration, to indicate if you would prefer to have your child drive or if you would like to add other responsible adults who have your permission to check your student in and out.

**_Please remember to bring your ID._**  If your student is driving themself, _**they**_ should bring their driver's license or school ID.

> Participants in the course will be asked to participate in an evaluation of their experiences and perceptions. This is voluntary and all parents and students will be provided additional information at the time of enrollment to consent to participating in an end of the program survey. In order to continually improve the experiences of participating students, students will be provided a ten-minute survey at the completion of the course. The data will only be used if both parents and child consent to data collection; your childâ€™s status in the program is not impacted by the decision to complete the survey.  The program is partnering with the College Research and Evaluation Services Team (CREST) at ASU provide external evaluation support to grants and will never share participant identifiers with program faculty or staff. Responses will be aggregated and reported in summary form for program improvement and possibly presentations or publications, but no identifying information will ever be shared.  We appreciate your consideration to participate in this evaluation endeavor.

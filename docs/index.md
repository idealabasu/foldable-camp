## Introduction

Participants will be introduced to the principles of robot design through origami -- the art of paper folding -- to prototype, ideate, and get a hands-on sense of the physics of robots.

## Topics

Participants will learn:

* How to use the biological world as a source of inspiration for designing robots, and how to translate those principles into a set of engineering design goals.
* How to ideate, prototype, and synthesize robotic devices through folded mechanisms, and how force, torque, and motion can be tuned through these structures to make robots move better.
* Coding a microcontroller to generate motion with an RC servo-motor.
* How to program the robot to respond to user and sensory input.

This week-long, hands-on, project-based approach will emphasize problem identification, brainstorming, problem solving, rapid prototyping, teamwork, and communication. The camp will culminate with a final robot build -- that students can program to move through their environment.

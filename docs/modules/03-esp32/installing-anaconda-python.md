## Introduction

This tutorial is for installing the anaconda python distribution on windows.

## Windows Installation

These installation instructions are for computers that **do** **not** have Python or Anaconda installed already. Python and Anaconda do not come installed by default on most computers so if you haven't installed them intentionally, these instructions likely apply to you. If you **do** have another version of Python installed, then please ask Dr.Â Aukes for further details.

### Anaconda Instructions

**Note:** These instructions are for the smaller "Miniconda" distribution, that includes only the ```conda``` package manager that you can use to install only the packages that you want.  You can also install the full [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) distribution, and follow the same basic instructions.

1. Download and install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) ([win64 quick link](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe)) with the following options:
    - Install for "All Users (requires admin privileges)" to the default directory (e.g., C:\\ProgramData\\Miniconda3 )
    - Check the "Add Miniconda3 to the system PATH environment variable" box
    - Check the "Register Miniconda3 as the system Python 3.9" box
2. Install additional software packages
    a.  In Windows, go to the search bar and type "cmd". Once you see the Command Prompt app in the list, right click on it and choose "Run as administrator" from the contextual menu.
    b.  Paste each of the following lines (one at a time) at the command prompt and press enter:

``` {.bash}
conda update --all
```

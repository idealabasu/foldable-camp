See our general information page for map and details. We will hold a student showcase from 3pm-4pm on Friday, June 16 . Check-in / Check-Out Doors open at 9am. Check-in is 9:00am to 9:15am . Doors close at 4pm. Please pick up your child between 3:45pm-4:00pm . We will station one of our teaching team out in Lot 30 near the 20-minute parking spots on Monday morning to guide campers and parents to the room. If you don't see anyone please proceed to the classroom to check your student in there. It is highly encouraged that you drop your student off each day rather than have them drive and pay for parking, as it is the most economical option (Parking information below ). Lot 30 is the closest and easiest dropoff location. There are 2 free 20-minute pickup/dropoff spots located here . We ask that you bring an ID each day, as our check-in/check-out procedure requires that we release students to an approved individual. You should have filled out your check-in/check-out preferences during registration, to indicate if you would prefer to have your child drive or if you would like to add other responsible adults who have your permission to check your student in and out. Please remember to bring your ID. If your student is driving themself, they should bring their driver's license or school ID. Locations Camp Classroom Peralta Hall Room 103 7171 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall Mesa, AZ 85212 Polytechnic Student Union 5999 S Backus Mall Mesa, AZ 85212 Parking Parking is strictly enforced at ASU; you must have a permit to park in most ASU lots, even in Summer. If your student is driving themselves, they should park in metered parking. This is available in lot 29 (closer) or lot 10 (overflow location). $12/day Credit card required at kiosk, or use the ParkMobile App (pre-install the app on your student's phone and connect a payment option in advance) Evaluation Participants in the course will be asked to participate in an evaluation of their experiences and perceptions. This is voluntary and all parents and students will be provided additional information at the time of enrollment to consent to participating in an end of the program survey. In order to continually improve the experiences of participating students, students will be provided a ten-minute survey at the completion of the course. The data will only be used if both parents and child consent to data collection; your child\u2019s status in the program is not impacted by the decision to complete the survey. The program is partnering with the College Research and Evaluation Services Team (CREST) at ASU provide external evaluation support to grants and will never share participant identifiers with program faculty or staff. Responses will be aggregated and reported in summary form for program improvement and possibly presentations or publications, but no identifying information will ever be shared.

Python and Anaconda do not come installed by default on most computers so if you haven't installed them intentionally, these instructions likely apply to you. If you do have another version of Python installed, then please ask Dr. Aukes for further details. Anaconda Instructions Note: These instructions are for the smaller \"Miniconda\" distribution, that includes only the conda package manager that you can use to install only the packages that you want. You can also install the full Anaconda distribution, and follow the same basic instructions. Download and install miniconda ( win64 quick link ) with the following options: Install for \"Just for Me\" to the default directory (e.g., C:\\ProgramData\\Miniconda3 ) the \"install for everyone\" option no longer permits you to add python to the system PATH Check the \"Add Miniconda3 to the system PATH environment variable\" box Check the \"Register Miniconda3 as the system Python\" box set other options as you like. Install additional software packages In Windows, go to the search bar and type \"cmd\".

Select the same code folder as above and specify a project name (like \"hello-world\"). Select the option to create a subdirectory with the micropython folder. Connect your device via usb to your computer Within the \"hello-world\" project that is created within the \"Pymakr: Projects\" tab, add a new device. Follow the prompts to select the appropriate com port Connect to the device by selecting the lightning bolt icon Open up a terminal window by selecting the box with an arrow in it A terminal window should open and look like this: ```python MicroPython v1.19.1 on 2022-06-18; ESP32 module with ESP32 Type \"help()\" for more information. ``` At the command prompt, type in python print('hello world') which should return python hello world If you wish to disconnect, you can use: Working with the Python interpreter Micropython can either run code from the interpreter (the \"terminal\" as vs code puts it), or by loading a file from its onboard storage. When the ESP32 is reset (using the EN button), it looks for two files, in a specific order: boot.py main.py if there are any loops in these files that prevent execution from ending, you must type ctrl+c to terminate execution from the interpreter window. This will stop any python files from running and bring control back to the interpreter You must always stop execution on the ESP32 before trying to upload files to it. Saving files to/from the ESP32 Within the \"Pymakr: Projects\" workspace there are several other buttons that you can use to sync files to the esp32 Upload project to device: Uploads all your project files to the device Download project from device: Pulls files off the device Open in Explorer: This opens up the ESP32 as a virtual file system in the file explorer and allows you to investigate and work with the file system directly.
